Uploading code that I created as part of
https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/

Day 1 to 14 were all using an online python editor so I don't have folders for those days.
There is not a folder for every day as some of the days you are just learning a new topic and then the next day you apply it by creating a project.

Day15 was coffeemachineprogram

Notes:
All days took at least an hour (porbably 70-80 minutes) to work through the videos and then complete the pracitical assignment.
Before doing this course I hadn't learned any python.  At school we learnt VB.Net.
As I am likely to need to learn Python for University I plan to continue with this course.  

Things I learnt
Syntax for things like if statements, for loops, methods, classes..
Using libraries\Installing packages - For VB.Net we couldn't cover how to use additional software
List Comprehension
